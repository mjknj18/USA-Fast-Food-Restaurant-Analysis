# USA-Fast-Food-Restaurant-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to build an interactive dashboard from USA fast food restaurant location data using a multi-faceted approach. First, Python, with Pandas and SQLAlchemy, was used to perform an ETL process to transfer the data to a SQL database. Then, Python, with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Pandas, was used to create a local application with several user-selectable routes for processing and transfer to a specific HTML web page. Finally, JavaScript, with Charts JS and Leaflet, was used to create the interactive visualizations within each web page.
